ü©∫ Django Disease Prediction SystemA web application built with Django and Machine Learning (Scikit-learn) that provides predictions for various diseases based on user input.The system currently supports prediction for the following conditions:Heart DiseaseKidney DiseaseCervical ConditionsüöÄ Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.PrerequisitesYou need the following software installed on your system:Python 3.10+ (The project environment uses Python 3.12)Git (For cloning the repository)1. Clone the RepositoryOpen your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the project files:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd d # The main project directory
2. Set up the Virtual EnvironmentIt is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.On Windows:python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
(The environment name env matches the one in your folder structure.)3. Install DependenciesWith the virtual environment activated, install all required packages using pip.pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: This step assumes you have a requirements.txt file in the root directory listing packages like Django, pandas, and scikit-learn.4. Database MigrationsApply the initial database migrations for the Django project.python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
5. Run the ServerFinally, start the Django development server:python manage.py runserver
The application will now be running at:http://127.0.0.1:8000/üìù Project Structure HighlightsDirectoryPurposeDjangoWellPred/The main Django project configuration (settings, URLs).app/Primary Django application (views, basic models, logic).templates/Contains HTML templates (heart/, kidney/, cervical/ UI).static/Static assets like CSS and JavaScript.pickles/Crucial: Stores the pre-trained machine learning models (e.g., heart_model.pkl).env/The Python Virtual Environment.‚öôÔ∏è How Prediction WorksA user navigates to a prediction page (e.g., /heart/).The user inputs the required health parameters into the form.The Django view loads the corresponding machine learning model from the pickles/ directory using joblib or pickle.The input data is processed (e.g., scaled, encoded) and fed into the model.The model returns a prediction (e.g., 0 or 1).The result is displayed to the user on the webpage.ü§ù ContributingIf you find a bug or have an enhancement idea, please open an issue or submit a pull request!
